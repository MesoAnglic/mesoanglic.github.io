            <h2>About the Zoso Project</h2>
            <p>The Zoso Project is a personal website for things I find interesting. I happen to find a lot of things interesting, so this means the website will have a lot of those same things, from economics to technology.</p>

            <p>The website will include writings that are of medium length on those interesting things, as well as translations of some of those interesting things, and an archive for my own moments and for works by others that I wish to preserve.</p>
            
            <h2>About the Author</h2>
            <p>My name is Zoso, although you can call me Fahad, or Felix.</p>

            <p>I was born in 2007 in the UAE, and I live in Iraq and possess only Iraqi citizenship. I am a very curious and openminded person, and someone who wants to foster discussions. That's all you need to know about me.</p>

            <p>As of 2025 I am a high school student who is participating in the INASMO team selection tests for qualification to the 2026 IMO.</p>
