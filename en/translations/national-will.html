            <p class="article-subtitle">An English translation of the Chinese military novel by 野狼獾 (Wild Wolverine).</p>

            <h2>About the Novel</h2>
            <p>国家意志 (National Will), also published under the title 雷霆反击 (Thunder Counterattack), is a military fiction novel first serialised on the <a href="https://book.tiexue.net/">Tiexue</a> reading platform in 2011. It spans 821 chapters and roughly three million characters. The novel simulates a conflict between India and Pakistan that escalates into a full-scale Sino-Indian war across land, sea, and air, drawing on approximately 300 types of real military equipment. It has been called "the Everest of military fiction" (军文中的珠穆朗玛) in Chinese online circles, and its opening scenario bore a striking resemblance to the real 2019 India-Pakistan clash over Kashmir, despite having been written years earlier.</p>

            <p>As far as I am aware, no English translation of this novel has previously existed.</p>

            <h2>Translator's Note</h2>
            <p>Chinese military novels are very terse, straightforward, and technical. National Will is even more so. My approach to translation was to try and approximate the terseness as best as I could in an English context, keeping as much of the technical detail as possible; it was a major draw for the novel amongst the Chinese web novel sphere. At the same time, while I don't wish to take many liberties, I did take some to make sure that the novel doesn't fall apart in English.</p>
              
            <p>Footnotes are provided for military terminology, unit designations, geographical references, and other context that an Anglophone reader would not be expected to know.</p>
